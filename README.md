# README
This is a game I made while familiarizing myself with [snap.svg](http://snapsvg.io), a HTML5 javascript svg library.

It also uses [gulp](http://gulpjs.com), which was pretty new when I made it.

You can play the game at [my website](http://recidivistsw.com/snapTT/index.html).

Here is a [blog post](http://recidivistsw.com/developer-notes/snapsvg-html-5-game.html) about this game
